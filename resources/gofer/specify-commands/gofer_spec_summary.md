# Gofer Spec Summary

Generate a business-friendly summary of the current feature and write it to
`.specify/specs/{feature}/spec-summary.md`.

Use this when a stakeholder or implementation team needs the plain-language
purpose, expected outcomes, and scope boundaries without diving into the full
spec.

When you run this helper:

1. Read the approved feature-local artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`,
   `contract-pack.md`, `quickstart.md`) and summarize only what is already in
   scope.
2. Keep the summary business-facing and humble. Do not turn it into a PRD or an
   issue-tracker export.
3. Write the artifact only to `.specify/specs/{feature}/spec-summary.md`.
4. If the target file already exists, replace it and prepend a regeneration note
   such as `<!-- regenerated at [ISO timestamp] -->`.
5. Include the minimum provenance schema:
   - `GeneratedAt`
   - `SourceCommandId`
   - `SourceInputs`
   - `OverwriteNoticeWhenApplicable`

The generated summary must contain these sections:

- `## Provenance`
- `## What`
- `## Why`
- `## Acceptance Criteria`
- `## Out of Scope`

Keep the content Gofer-owned. Do not copy upstream Matt Pocock skill text
verbatim.
