# Gofer Spec Summary

## Token And Cost Policy
<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:start -->

Before spawning agents, calling tools, or loading large files:

1. Treat `.specify/memory/gofer-model-policy.yaml` as the repo-owned source of truth for simple, medium, hard, and arbiter model routing. If it is missing, run `/gofer:bootstrap-workspace` before continuing.
2. Use the cheapest capable model first.
   - Claude: Haiku for scouting/extraction; Sonnet for normal implementation, synthesis, validation, and security; Opus for high-risk arbitration or release-critical failures.
   - Codex/OpenAI: GPT mini for simple coding; GPT nano only for locate/classify/summarize/mechanical work; GPT-5.3-Codex or flagship GPT for tool-heavy coding, architecture, and release-critical validation.
   - Gemini: Flash-Lite for cheap large-context scan/summarize; Flash for default research synthesis; Pro for large-context architecture or high-risk arbitration.
   - Copilot: prefer Auto for simple and default work; ask the user before choosing a paid/high-tier picker model for hard security, architecture, or release gates.
3. Keep raw tool output out of the main conversation context. Save stable findings to `.specify/specs/{feature}/context-bundle.md`, then work from summaries.
4. Use provider prompt/context caching only for stable, non-secret prefixes: Gofer scaffold, AGENTS/CLAUDE/Copilot instructions, constitution, repo map, stage contracts, and validation rubric.
5. Before continuing after large research, planning, implementation, or validation bursts, checkpoint the durable artifacts and compact/clear/resume context when the host supports it.
6. Escalate model tier only when a cheaper pass is low-confidence, contradictory, security-sensitive, or blocking release quality.
<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:end -->

Generate a business-friendly summary of the current feature and write it to
`.specify/specs/{feature}/spec-summary.md`.

Use this when a stakeholder or implementation team needs the plain-language
purpose, expected outcomes, and scope boundaries without diving into the full
spec.

When you run this helper:

1. Read the approved feature-local artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`,
   `contract-pack.md`, `quickstart.md`) and summarize only what is already in
   scope.
2. Keep the summary business-facing and humble. Do not turn it into a PRD or an
   issue-tracker export.
3. Write the artifact only to `.specify/specs/{feature}/spec-summary.md`.
4. If the target file already exists, replace it and prepend a regeneration note
   such as `<!-- regenerated at [ISO timestamp] -->`.
5. Include the minimum provenance schema:
   - `GeneratedAt`
   - `SourceCommandId`
   - `SourceInputs`
   - `OverwriteNoticeWhenApplicable`

The generated summary must contain these sections:

- `## Provenance`
- `## What`
- `## Why`
- `## Acceptance Criteria`
- `## Out of Scope`

Keep the content Gofer-owned. Do not copy upstream Matt Pocock skill text
verbatim.
